In this section I will refer the most interesting material that I found in my journey.

# Dimensionality Reduction 
Is a powerful technique that is widely used in data analytics and data science to help visualize data, select good features, and to train models efficiently.

# Loss function
Machines learn by means of a loss function. Itâ€™s a method of evaluating how well specific algorithm models the given data. If predictions deviates too much from actual results, loss function would cough up a very large number. Gradually, with the help of some optimization function, loss function learns to reduce the error in prediction. In this article we will go through several loss functions and their applications in the domain of machine/deep learning.
